The favicon.png file is an image file and cannot be generated as text content. To change the website tab logo, you need to replace the existing favicon.png file located at `c:\Users\KIIT\Desktop\code-synth-proto\_\apps\web\src\__create\favicon.png` with your new favicon image file. 

Make sure the new image is in PNG format and has the appropriate dimensions (typically 16x16 or 32x32 pixels) for a favicon.
